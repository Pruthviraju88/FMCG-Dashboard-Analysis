# FMCG-Dashboard-Analysis
FMCG ( AlitQ Mart ) has provided data regarding their mart and asked us to analyze the data and give a insight on it.
We have built the Dashboard so the AtliQ mart stakeholders can have access to it and it can be used for improving the business in all ways.

# Project Pipeline

- Data Transformation: Null values , missing values were found and cleared and few metrics provided by HR manager were created in the form of DAX measures and added few new columns to get the desired metrics.
- Data Modelling: Connected all the datasets with based on some defined primary keys such as date and delivery date. Also, created many measures, calculated columns and parameters for data analysis and dashboarding using DAX.
